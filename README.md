# ECHO PWA

**Your wiser self, becoming.**

A companion that learns who you are and becomes a wiser reflection of you.
100% offline. 100% private. No external AI. Runs on any device.

## What This Is

ECHO is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React + Vite. It runs entirely on your device — no server, no API calls, no data leaving your phone. The AI engine is built from first principles in pure JavaScript.

**Features:**
- Breathing orb that pulses with your mood
- Mood-reactive UI — the entire app shifts colour as ECHO reads your emotional state
- Memory whispers — past thoughts drift faintly in the background
- Personal knowledge graph — builds a living map of who you are
- Pattern detection — finds cycles, contradictions, and growth across time
- Wiser You mode — speaks as your highest self once it knows you well enough
- Private journal — ECHO reads silently and learns from the unfiltered you
- Fully offline — works with no internet connection after first load
- Installable — add to home screen on any phone

## Deploy to Netlify in 5 Steps

### Step 1 — Install Node.js
Download from https://nodejs.org (choose LTS version)
Verify: `node --version` should show v18 or higher

### Step 2 — Install dependencies
```bash
cd echo-pwa
npm install
```

### Step 3 — Test locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser. ECHO should load.

### Step 4 — Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates a `dist/` folder with your app.

### Step 5 — Deploy to Netlify

**Option A — Drag and drop (easiest):**
1. Go to https://netlify.com and sign up (free)
2. From your dashboard, drag the `dist/` folder onto the page
3. Netlify gives you a live URL instantly

**Option B — Connect GitHub (recommended for updates):**
1. Push this project to a GitHub repository
2. Go to https://netlify.com → New Site → Import from Git
3. Select your repository
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Publish directory: `dist`
6. Click Deploy

Your app is live. Share the URL with anyone — they can install ECHO on their phone from the browser.

## The ECHO Engine

ECHO's AI is built entirely from scratch — no OpenAI, no Claude API, no external services.

**Module 1 — Lexical Parser:** reads your words, extracts emotion from 8 families, intent from 6 types, urgency, depth, and key concepts.

**Module 2 — Knowledge Graph:** builds a living map of everything you share. Concepts become nodes. Co-occurrences become edges. Grows every conversation.

**Module 3 — Pattern Reasoner:** finds recurring emotions, goal-fear contradictions, growth over time, avoidance patterns.

**Module 4 — Response Constructor:** builds personalised responses from your profile + curated wisdom library. References your specific values, fears, and goals.

**Module 5 — Metacognition:** knows what it knows and what it doesn't. Tracks gaps. Builds a confidence score. Gets more precise as it learns more.

**Module 6 — Wiser Self Engine:** models your highest self and speaks back with specificity — your values, your contradictions, your patterns.

## Privacy

Everything stays on your device. ECHO uses IndexedDB (browser storage) — no account, no server, no data transmission. Your memories are yours alone.

Built with love. ECHO Engine v1.0.
