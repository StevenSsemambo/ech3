// ECHO Brain — Custom Intelligence Layer v2
// Pure offline logic. No API. No internet required.
//
// What this does differently from constructResponse:
//   - It READS the user's actual words and reflects them back specifically
//   - It composes dynamic sentences rather than picking from static pools
//   - It threads context from echoMemory across the session
//   - It generates responses that reference what was literally said
//   - It has its own opinion / experience / belief injection logic
//   - Falls through to constructResponse as a rich fallback
//
// processWithBrain(userText, history, memory, isWiser)
//   → [1] Direct question routing
//   → [2] Anchor extraction — what did they literally say?
//   → [3] Compose: ack → observation → reflection → context thread → experience → closing
//   → Falls back to constructResponse if output thin
