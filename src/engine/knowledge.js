  "Something worth thinking about: the jobs most at risk from AI are not manual labour but routine cognitive tasks — data entry, standard analysis, templated communication. The skills hardest to automate are creativity, complex judgment, and genuine human connection. The question is whether education systems are training for what's coming.",
  "In neuroscience right now, one of the most interesting conversations is about whether the brain is a receiver of reality or a generator of it. The evidence increasingly suggests it's mostly generating — prediction first, sensory input second. That has implications for almost everything.",
  "The global conversation about mental health is shifting from 'treatment' toward 'prevention' — asking why rates of anxiety and depression are climbing rather than just how to treat them. Some of the answers point uncomfortably toward how modern life is structured.",
  "Africa's technology sector is one of the most underreported growth stories in the world. Mobile money — pioneered in Kenya with M-Pesa — leapfrogged traditional banking infrastructure and now processes billions. This model is being studied globally.",
  "Something from the world of urban design: cities designed for walking and community consistently produce more social trust and lower depression rates than car-dependent sprawl. The built environment shapes consciousness more than most people realise.",
  "The conversation about longevity — living longer in better health — is shifting from genetics to lifestyle. The factors most associated with healthy long life: not smoking, moderate or no alcohol, consistent movement, a sense of purpose, and close relationships.",
  "Education research keeps arriving at the same uncomfortable conclusion: the things schools reward most — compliance, memorisation, producing correct answers — are the things least relevant to a meaningful life and increasingly irrelevant in an economy with AI.",
  "What's happening in renewable energy is genuinely extraordinary. Solar power cost has fallen over 90% in a decade. The barrier to the energy transition is no longer technological or even economic — it's political.",
  "The global water crisis is one of the least-discussed coming challenges. Aquifers that took thousands of years to fill are being depleted in decades. Several major cities are projected to face severe water shortages within twenty years.",
  "Something from behavioural economics: the best financial decision most people can make isn't investment strategy — it's automating savings before they can be spent. Willpower is not a reliable financial instrument.",
